Introduction

This extension was started as a way of fixing the American dates, and quickly exploded into a load of other features.

It was used as a way of teaching myself how to use javascript properly.

What are the potential problems?

Most of the code relies on Fanfiction.net's layout not changing.  If they change certain things, the extension will fail.
